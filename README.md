Nimble utilizes Laravel Mix for script bundling and compilation. Laravel Mix is a robust asset compilation tool built on top of webpack, offering a streamlined approach to managing and compiling JavaScript and CSS assets. By integrating Laravel Mix into Nimble's build process, developers benefit from simplified configuration and enhanced performance when bundling scripts.

The following line in your HTML file indicates the inclusion of the bundled JavaScript file generated by Laravel Mix in the ./index.js during the build process:

``` html
<script src="./index.js"></script>
```
